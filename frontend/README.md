## Idea

Project based on the 'MERN Stack Course' by Beau Carnes via freeCodeCamp.org: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrHNSanmqQ4&.

Features and styles have been customized, and  depricated functions and modules have been upgraded, including react-router-dom. 

## Data

Data comes from MongoDB's NYC Restaurants sample data. 

## Tools
database - Mongo DB
some components - Bootstrap

## Future Directions
If I were to spend anymore time on this app, I'd:
i. link to a different database-- is there a free one for national/global restaurants, instead of the NYC database? 

## Hire me
I'm really just tryna get hired. Hit me up:
